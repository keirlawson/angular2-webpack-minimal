# Angular2 minimal webpack setup
A minimalistic starter setup for using Angular2 with TypeScript and Webpack.  

This setup delibaretly excludes unit tests, linting etc in favour of a simple setup 
that can be later customised as needed by the developer.

## Usage

Simply clone this repo, run `npm install` inside the directory and then `npm start` to launch the webpack dev server.
